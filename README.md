## MediTrack Centralised Pharmacy Management System
The MediTrack System is designed to modernize and provides an efficient way of medicine purchasing and delivery for patients, pharmacies, and suppliers. The current problem in the healthcare sector is the lack of real-time medicine availability information, which leads to delays in obtaining medications in 
critical situations, unnecessary pharmacy visits, wastage of time, and medicine shortages. This system bridges the gap between patients, pharmacies, and suppliers, ensuring that medicines are available when needed.
